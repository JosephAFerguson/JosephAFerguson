## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I am a computer science student at the University of Cincinnati.
A few topics that I am interested in are data analysis, software engineering, network engineering, and game development.
As all things go, I am still a beginner in this vast field of knowledge. My github mainly features projects that showcase my learning.
